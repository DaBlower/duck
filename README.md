# Duck
This is just a simple Slack bot for me to use that has a few utilities

## Try it out
You can test it out (if you're in the HC slack) [here](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C09ETD04JH1)

## Features
It doesn't have many, but these are the ones so far
1. A sticky note feature (run with /sticky-note)
2. A dice roller (use /d6 or /dx)
